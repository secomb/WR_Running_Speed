# WR_Running_Speed

**Modeling of world record running data as a function of distance and age**

These MATLAB files accompany the manuscript "An empirical model for world record running speeds with distance, age, and sex: anaerobic and aerobic contributions to performance" by Tuhin K. Roy, Michael J. Joyner, Jonathon W. Senefeld, Chad C. Wiggins, Timothy W. Secomb (under review)

1. The program WRR_main.m generates estimates of parameters for the model described in the above paper.  The additional files included contain required functions and must be placed in the same directory as the main program.  The data file is called Running4.xlsx.
